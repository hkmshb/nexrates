========

Naira Exchange Rates (nexrates) is a free API service for current and historic Naira exchange rates
published by the `Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) <https://cbn.gov.ng/rates/>`_. This is inspired and
based off the excellent `exchangeratesapi <https://exchangeratesapi.io>`_ open source `project
<https://github.com/exchangeratesapi>`_.
